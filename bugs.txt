The first 2 countries are getting infected faster than they should be
    Actually on the first 2 countries infected population are being iterated at all. The others aren't.
Fixed: the int time infected wasn't initialized so it maxed out the infected and made all the people immune after the first day

Each country had 1 extra person than they should have
Fixed: Was not properly if the file was empty

Quarantine functionality is completely broken

Mask Wearing is completely broken

Program didn't end after 6 months had passed
Fixed: While loop wasn't condition wasn't based on time passed

More people are getting infected than people that exist
Fixed: if infected person can't get infected again

Its not possible for all people to get infected
